All of Certus One's founders fully trust each other, have a long history of working together
and neither of us has any intention to walk away. However, we still need to consider
the risk of either of us quitting or us falling out with each other, and protect our company
and our customers from this risk.

There are many examples of companies meeting an untimely end due to trivial disagreements
or founders leaving early while keeping significant stock in the company, making life difficult
for the remaining founders when they want to bring in additional investors.

This is why it's essential to have a carefully designed shareholder contract with clearly
defined responsibilities (prevent many disagreements from occuring in the first place).

Business continuity plans are just as important as proper systems engineering, the latter being
of little use if the company owning the servers goes under.
