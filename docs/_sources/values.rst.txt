Excellence
==========

**Excellence** is one of our core values.

Our success is a direct measure of the quality of our work. There's no hyper-growth,
just delivering great, in-depth advice and robust infrastructure.

No "moving fast and break things".

There's no

No perfectionism or pedantry, but going home knowing we did the best work we possible could.

This also means:

- Reducing our workload by clever and lean designs, not by taking bad shortcuts.

- Not overcommitting ourselves

If in doubt, we take an extra ten minutes to fix up that piece of internal documentation,
discuss something before we start building it, or complete an overdue refactoring.

Maintaining code is much more expensive than writing it, and each minute we spend is an
investment that immediately starts paying dividends. If our experience taught us anything, is
that technical debt is one of the .


Work-life balance
=================

While early-stage companies like ours are often associated with "crunch time", all-nighters,
and 80 hours weeks, we don't believe that these are necessary or, in fact, more productive than
maintaining a healthy schedule.

We still expect to pull the occasional all-nighter or experience crunch periods (which are
exhausting, but also very rewarding), but not for any prolonged period of time.

We prefer a sustainable pace over a series of exhausting sprints. The quality of our work is directly
related to our well-being.

and covering for each other if we need a rest.


Constructive criticism
======================

Being able to constructively criticize each other is one of our most important values.

We want to establish devoid of personal.

This is particularly important for our co-founders.
