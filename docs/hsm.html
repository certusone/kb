<h1>HSM for Signing<a class="headerlink" href="#hsm-for-signing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To ensure high security of your validator, you will want to sign your votes
and block proposals using a <a class="reference internal" href="#hsm">HSM</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="tendermint-introduction">
<h3>Tendermint introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#tendermint-introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the Tendermint consensus, all validators in the active validator set participate by submitting
block proposals and voting on them (using prevotes and precommits).</p>
<p>The vote of your validator is authenticated using a cryptographic signature,
so that other people know that the vote came from you and no one can impersonate you (which
would break the consensus mechanism).</p>
<p>This coordinated consensus, which is split into several steps, ensures that at least
2/3+ of the validators have the same <a class="reference internal" href="#view">view</a> of the network since it requires 2/3+ votes
for a block in order to finalize it.</p>
<p>With this restriction in place, we would assume that it is impossible for two different
chains (<em>forks</em>) to exist a time, since it is not possible to get 2 times 2/3+ votes
on two <a class="reference internal" href="#conflicting">conflicting</a> blocks in a 3/3 validator set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="double-signing">
<h3>Double signing<a class="headerlink" href="#double-signing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>However, this excludes the scenario of double voting/proposing.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the byzantine proposer in the consensus round creates two
<a class="reference internal" href="#conflicting">conflicting</a> blocks and sends them out to the network.</p>
<p>If we assume that we also have other byzantine actors in the validator set
which want to profit from both chains, these will also vote for both blocks.</p>
<p>That means that honest nodes in the network could see 2 different blocks at the same height with different contents and hashes.
From this point on the network has <strong>forked</strong>.</p>
<p>Outside viewers of the network will not know which block is correct and from now on there will not be a single truth.
This is the exact scenario we want to prevent with PBFT-like consensus systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-cosmos-prevents-forks">
<h3>How Cosmos prevents forks<a class="headerlink" href="#how-cosmos-prevents-forks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now that we know the 2 reasons that cause forks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Conflicting proposals by the same validator</li>
<li>Conflicting votes by the same validator</li>
</ul>
<p>Both can be summarized as <strong>double signing</strong>. In order to create
two conflicting proposals/votes, a validator needs to sign two consensus messages
for the same <a class="reference internal" href="#hrs">HRS</a> pair with its key.</p>
<p>Tendermint allows other validators to record evidence of byzantine behaviour in blocks. Cosmos
makes use of this features and slashes validators that double sign. At the moment, the slashing
rate is set to 20% of all bonded Atoms, which is very substantial amount.</p>
<p>This strict slashing condition makes it extremely important for validators to avoid double
signing in order to ensure network security and prevent being slashed.</p>

<div class="section" id="problems-of-the-default-signing-implementation">
<h3>Problems of the default signing implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-of-the-default-signing-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Lets assume a scenrio in which your validator host is compromised by a malicious actor who wants
to financially hurt you and your <em>customers</em> (people staking tokens with you).</p>
<p>If you are using the default <em>FilePV</em>, which stores the private key associated with your validator
on the file system, the attacker can compromise your host and steal your <cite>priv_validator.json</cite> file.
From then on, he has the ability to sign any consensus message with your validator’s key.</p>
<p>That way, the attacker could <strong>double sign</strong> on your behalf, triggering the slashing conditions for
you forever since validator keys cannot currently be replaced, <em>ruining your validator</em>.</p>
<p>For this reason, it’s crucial that your validator key cannot be stolen, even if your node is
compromised.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-solution">
<h3>The solution<a class="headerlink" href="#the-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A HSM is a separate hardware component that stores keys and - unless configured to perform
differently - will not allow you to extract the private keys it stores. However, it will use the
private key to sign/encrypt data for you.</p>
<p>HSMs use special tamper-proof secure elements which make it extremely hard to extract the secret keys,
even with physical access.</p>
<p>This allows you to store your validator private key on a HSM and not leave it exposed on the filesystem
of the validator host.</p>
<p>Using a special software component, Tendermint will ask the HSM to sign the consensus message without
ever handling the private key itself.</p>
<p>In case of validator compromise, the attacker would not be able to extract your private key and
he could only make you double sign as long as he controls your host.</p>
<p>This can be further mitigated by having an encrypted session between Tendermint and the HSM and
doing proper secrets management. With such measures in place, it would be harder for a validator
to get the HSM to sign arbitrary data and you would have more time to detect and mitigate the attack.</p>

<h3>KMS by Tendermint<a class="headerlink" href="#kms-by-tendermint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>KMS (Key Management Service) is a reference implementation of pluggable signing modules in a
separate software component, maintained by Tendermint.</p>
<img alt="_images/kms.svg" src="_images/kms.svg" /><p>KMS is a separate process which handles signing and implements double signing protection
(like keeping track of the last signed messages).</p>
<p>This component communicates with the Tendermint node using a encrypted channel
to prevent <a class="reference internal" href="#mitm">MITM</a> attacks.</p>
<p>Signers are implemented as plugins which makes is very extensible and flexible.
Examples of implemented signers include the YubiHSM2, Ledger Nano S and the
traditional file signer mentioned above.</p>
<p>The advantage of running a separate host (or an SGX enclave) for key management
is that in case of a validator host compromise, your KMS host will remain secure and
the built-in double signing protection in the KMS will prevent it from responding to
double signing requests from the compromised validator host.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the KMS service is actively being developed and not yet ready to be used.</p>
<p>You can watch the progress and contribute here in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tendermint/kms">KMS Github</a> repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aiakos-by-certus-one">
<h3>Aiakos by Certus One<a class="headerlink" href="#aiakos-by-certus-one" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While KMS connects to Tendermint via a socket, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/certusone/aiakos">Aiakos</a>
is an in-process signer implementation and compiled into gaiad.
Aiakos uses the PrivValidator interface of Tendermint to implement a direct wrapper to the YubiHSM2.</p>
<p>We also implemented a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/certusone/yubihsm-go">YubiHSM Go library</a>.</p>
<p>In order to use Aiakos, you have to install the Yubico YubiHSM2 connector on your host
and apply a small patch your Cosmos node source to register it (a validator should always build
their own cosmos-sdk binaries - see the article on building Cosmos).</p>
<p>Your Cosmos node will then attempt to connect to the YubiHSM and optionally import a key
specified by you to the HSM. All consensus messages will then be signed using the HSM.</p>
<p>We initially designed Aiakos as part of our proprietary JANUS active-active validator,
but it can also be used as a standalone signer. We found the socket interface to be too unreliable,
and KMS not ready for production, so we set out to build a minimal, easily audited YubiHSM 2
PrivValidator. We chose to write it in Go to avoid the extra complexity of using Rust, which we
thought offered little tangible security benefits over Go in this use case.</p>
<p>By being in-process, Aiakos is much more reliable, but slightly less secure than KMS since it
doesn’t implement double signing protection in the event of a validator compromise. We decided
that, for now, using the socket interface with the pre-release KMS software poses a greater risk
than the (unlikely, given the minimal attack surface for remote code execution) event of
an attacker somehow compromising the validator host, but not the KMS host unless completely
separate infrastructure is used for KMS.</p>
<p>Tendermint is written in Go, which is a memory-safe language, making remote code execution highly
unlikely. Most threat scenarios would involve a full infrastructure compromise, like a
compromised workstation, supply chain or operating system vendor.</p>
<p>The remaining issue of logic errors which would trick the validator into double signing can be
mitigated using double-signing prevention which we implemented at the JANUS layer.</p>
<p>However, we do believe that high-assurance double-signing prevention is worth pursuing, and we plan
to either switch JANUS to KMS once it’s ready, and/or work with the community to improve support for
out-of-process signers and move Aiakas and JANUS to an out-of-process model. That being said, this
will only provide a tangible security advantage if the out-of-process signer itself runs in an
isolated environment like SGX <em>and</em> is able to replicate state to standby instances in a
high-availability setup.</p>
